# M-median

Multivariate medians are robust competitors of the mean vector in estimating the
symmetry center of a multivariate distribution.
Projects Using R to test robustness of six different types of multivariate medians by their influence function, breakdown points.... Illustrate the usage of these median in the high dimensional data. Visualize these median and data depths by the bag plot and contour plot
